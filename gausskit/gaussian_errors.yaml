      lines_to_replace: []
      checkpoints_required: true
      inject_into: null
    notes: |
      This error occurs when Gaussian fails to project orbitals from a checkpoint file into the new basis or geometry. It often happens when the structure, basis set, or charge/multiplicity has changed between jobs.

      Fix:
        - Avoid using `guess=read` if the basis set or molecular geometry has changed.
        - If projection must be used, ensure that the new input exactly matches the original job in geometry and basis.
        - Alternatively, omit `guess=read` and let Gaussian generate a fresh guess.

      lines_to_replace: []
      checkpoints_required: false
      inject_into: null
    notes: |
      This error is caused by bad initial geometries, typically with atoms too close, causing molecular mechanics microiterations to fail.

      Fix:
        - Add `opt=calcfc` to recalculate the force constants instead of relying on guesses.
        - Alternatively, check and modify the starting geometry to increase the distance between close-contact atoms.
        - You may also want to visualize the structure and verify atom proximity before rerunning.

    notes: |
      This error occurs when the SCF procedure fails to converge.

      Fix:
        - Use `scf=qc` to switch to quadratic convergence.
        - Add `conver=8` to relax SCF convergence criteria slightly.
        - You may also try adding `int=ultrafine` or `scf=novaracc` if using DFT.
        - If error persists, try a better guess (e.g., `guess=read` from a previous checkpoint).

    notes: |
      Gaussian cannot find the van der Waals radius for one or more atoms when using electrostatic potential fitting methods (e.g., CHELPG).

      Fix:
        - Add `readradii` and manually specify van der Waals radii at the end of the input file.
        - Ensure `pop=chelpg` is present if this is the intended fitting method.

    notes: |
      Gaussian detected invalid angles or other issues while converting from Z-matrix to Cartesian coordinates.
      Commonly caused by angle values outside [0°, 180°] or malformed Z-matrix entries.

      Fix:
        - Switch to `opt=cartesian` to bypass internal coordinate system.
        - If using `geom=modredundant`, remove it and ensure your input geometry is correct.
        - Consider regenerating the input using Cartesian coordinates if the Z-matrix is unstable.

    notes: |
      This occurs during post-HF or TD-SCF calculations when the frozen-core approximation fails due to
      strong mixing between core and valence orbitals.

      Fix:
        - Use full correlation by adding (full) to the method: MP2 → MP2(full), CCSD(T) → CCSD(T,full).
        - Alternatively, add `IOp(8/11=1)` to bypass the check (make sure to verify physical validity afterward).

      leading to numerical instability.

      Fixes:
        - Add `IOp(8/11=1)` to allow Gaussian to continue past the instability warning.
        - Optionally switch to a functional with more Hartree–Fock exchange to increase the orbital gap.

    notes: |
      This error occurs in CISD, CCSD, or CCSD(T) calculations when the iterative solver fails to converge within the allowed number of cycles.

      Fixes:
        - Increase the maximum number of cycles using `maxcyc=100` or higher.
        - Inspect output for signs of energy convergence. If energies oscillate, check:
            * Geometry quality
            * Reference state
            * Basis set stability
        - Try refining the structure or switching to a different basis set.

    notes: |
      This error indicates that the calculation does not have enough memory allocated to complete a CISAX (Configuration Interaction Singles with Axis) task.

      Fixes:
        - Increase the memory in the input header using `%mem=8GB` or more.
        - Alternatively, reduce the number of processors used with `%nprocshared=4` or fewer.
        - Avoid memory-heavy operations if running on shared nodes or constrained environments.

    notes: |
      This error occurs when the numerical integration grid is too coarse for DFT, especially with large or diffuse basis sets.

      Fixes:
        - Use finer integration grids: `int=ultrafine` or `int=grid=300590`.
        - Combine with `scf=novaracc` and `guess=indo` for robustness.
        - Consider these together if isolated fixes fail.
