# PIMOM Orbital Swap Example

This folder demonstrates how to extract HOMO/LUMO indices from a Gaussian `.log` file and perform orbital swaps for PIMOM calculations.

## Instructions

1. Run:
   ```bash
   gausskit
   ```
2. Select `[1] PIMOM Swap Generator`
3. Choose `h2o_anion.log` when prompted.
4. Choose which orbital pairs you want to switch.
